# Payment Receipt System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete payment receipt system that automatically generates acknowledgement receipts for every successful customer payment. Receipts can be viewed and downloaded as PDF from the Invoice page.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### Database Model (`PaymentReceipt`)
- **Location**: `backend/models-postgres/index.js`
- **Fields**:
  - `receiptNumber`: Unique receipt number (format: RCP-YYYY-NNNN)
  - `paymentId`: Reference to the payment record
  - `invoiceId`: Reference to the invoice
  - `customerId`: Reference to the customer
  - `paymentDate`: Date and time of payment
  - `amount`: Payment amount
  - `totalAmount`: Total invoice amount
  - `remainingAmount`: Remaining balance after payment
  - `paymentMethod`: Payment method used (card/gcash/grabpay/maya)
  - `paymentReference`: Transaction reference from payment gateway
  - `status`: Either "Partial" or "Completed"
  - `receiptData`: Additional receipt metadata (JSON)

#### Database Migration
- **Location**: `backend/scripts/create-payment-receipts-table.js`
- **Run Command**: `node backend/scripts/create-payment-receipts-table.js`
- Creates the `PaymentReceipt` table with proper foreign keys and indexes
- Automatically creates indexes for optimal query performance

#### API Endpoints
- **Location**: `backend/routes/payments.js`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/payments/receipts/my` - Get all payment receipts for logged-in customer
  - `GET /api/payments/receipts/:receiptId` - Get specific receipt details
  - `GET /api/payments/receipts/:receiptId/download` - Download receipt as PDF

#### Controller Functions
- **Location**: `backend/controllers/paymentController.js`
- **Functions**:
  - `generateReceiptNumber()` - Generates unique receipt numbers (RCP-YYYY-NNNN)
  - `createPaymentReceipt()` - Creates receipt after successful payment
  - `getMyPaymentReceipts()` - Fetches all customer receipts
  - `getPaymentReceiptDetails()` - Fetches specific receipt details
  - `downloadPaymentReceipt()` - Handles receipt download

#### Automatic Receipt Generation
Receipts are automatically generated when:
- Card payments succeed (webhook: `payment.paid`)
- E-wallet payments succeed (webhook: `source.chargeable`)
- Status is set to "Partial" if invoice has remaining balance
- Status is set to "Completed" if invoice is fully paid

### 2. Frontend Implementation

  - `downloadPaymentReceipt()` - Download receipt data
  - `formatPaymentMethod()` - Format payment method display name
  - `generateReceiptHTML()` - Generate printable HTML receipt
  - `printReceipt()` - Open print dialog with formatted receipt

#### Invoice Page Updates

- **Features**:
  - "View Payment Receipts" button in header
  - Sliding modal from right showing all payment receipts
  - Click on any receipt to view detailed information in nested modal

## Usage Flow

### For Customers:
1. **Make Payment**: Customer makes a payment via Payment page
2. **Automatic Receipt**: System automatically generates receipt after payment confirmation
3. **View Receipts**: Navigate to Invoices page → Click "View Payment Receipts"
4. **Receipt List**: See all payment receipts with summary information
5. **View Details**: Click on any receipt to see full details in nested modal
6. **Download/Print**: Click "Download" to print or save as PDF

### For Developers:
1. **Run Migration**: Before deploying, run the migration script:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node scripts/create-payment-receipts-table.js
   ```

2. **Database Setup**: Ensure PostgreSQL connection is configured in `.env`

3. **Verification**: After payment is processed, check:
   - Receipt is created in database
   - Receipt appears in customer's receipt list
   - Receipt can be viewed and downloaded

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE "PaymentReceipt" (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  receipt_number VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  payment_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  invoice_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  payment_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0),
  total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  remaining_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
  payment_method VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  payment_reference VARCHAR(255),
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Partial' CHECK (status IN ('Partial', 'Completed')),
  receipt_data JSONB,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  FOREIGN KEY (payment_id) REFERENCES "Payment"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (invoice_id) REFERENCES "Invoice"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES "Customer"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend:
- ✅ `backend/models-postgres/index.js` - Added PaymentReceipt model
- ✅ `backend/scripts/create-payment-receipts-table.js` - New migration script
- ✅ `backend/controllers/paymentController.js` - Added receipt generation and API functions
- ✅ `backend/routes/payments.js` - Added receipt API routes

### Frontend:
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/receiptService.js` - New service for receipt operations
- ✅ `frontend/src/Components-CustomerPortal/Invoice.jsx` - Added receipt viewing features
- ✅ `frontend/src/Components-CustomerPortal/Payment.jsx` - Updated success message

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run migration script
- [ ] Make a test payment (card or e-wallet)
- [ ] Verify receipt is created in database
- [ ] Check receipt appears in "View Payment Receipts"
- [ ] Click on receipt to view details
- [ ] Test download/print functionality
- [ ] Verify status shows "Partial" for partial payments
- [ ] Verify status shows "Completed" for full payments
- [ ] Test with different payment methods (card, GCash, GrabPay, Maya)

## Notes

1. **Receipt Number Format**: RCP-YYYY-NNNN (e.g., RCP-2024-0001)
2. **Status Logic**: 
   - "Partial" when remaining balance > 0
   - "Completed" when remaining balance = 0
3. **PDF Generation**: Currently uses print dialog (browser native)
4. **Automatic Generation**: Receipts are created automatically by payment webhooks
5. **No Manual Creation**: Receipts cannot be manually created - they are auto-generated only

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Backend PDF generation using puppeteer or pdfkit
- Email receipt delivery
- Receipt templates customization
- Bulk receipt download
- Receipt search and filtering
- Admin view of all receipts

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check database connection
- Verify migration ran successfully
- Check webhook logs for payment processing
- Verify customer is authenticated
- Check browser console for frontend errors
