# PayMongo Integration - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary

The complete PayMongo payment gateway integration has been implemented. Customers can now make online payments using:
- **Credit/Debit Cards** (with 3D Secure support)
- **GCash**
- **GrabPay**
- **Maya (PayMaya)**

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/payments/create-payment-method` - Create payment method from card details
- `POST /api/payments/attach-payment-method` - Attach payment method to intent
- `POST /api/payments/create-payment-source` - Create e-wallet payment source

#### Controller Functions
- `createPaymentMethod()` - Validates and creates PayMongo payment methods
- `attachPaymentToIntent()` - Handles 3DS redirect and payment attachment
- `createPaymentSource()` - Creates sources for e-wallet payments

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### Enhanced Payment.jsx
**New Features:**
- Card input fields with real-time validation
  - Card number (formatted with spaces)
  - Expiry date (MM/YY format)
  - CVC/CVV
  - Cardholder name
- Automatic card number formatting
- Complete payment flow:
  - Create payment intent
  - Create payment method
  - Attach to intent
  - Handle 3DS redirect automatically
  - Handle e-wallet redirects

**Payment Flow:**
```
Card Payment:
User enters card details ‚Üí Create payment intent ‚Üí Create payment method 
‚Üí Attach to intent ‚Üí If 3DS required: redirect ‚Üí Complete authentication 
‚Üí Webhook updates payment ‚Üí Success!

E-Wallet Payment:
User selects e-wallet ‚Üí Create payment intent ‚Üí Create source 
‚Üí Redirect to e-wallet ‚Üí User completes payment ‚Üí Webhook updates payment 
‚Üí Success!
```

### 3. Service Layer

#### New Payment Services
```javascript
// Frontend services
createPaymentMethod(cardDetails, billingDetails)
attachPaymentToIntent(paymentIntentId, paymentMethodId, returnUrl, paymentId)
createPaymentSource(type, amount, invoiceId, paymentId)
```

## How to Test Right Now

### Quick Test - Card Payment (No 3DS)

1. **Start your servers:**
   ```bash
   # Backend should already be running
   # Frontend: cd my-ammex-website/frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Log in as a customer** at http://localhost:5173

3. **Navigate to an invoice:**
   - Go to Products > Invoices
   - Click "Make Payment" on any unpaid invoice

4. **Fill in the payment form:**
   - Amount: `100.00`
   - Payment Method: Select "Credit/Debit Card"
   - Card Number: `4343 4343 4343 4345`
   - Expiry: `12/25`
   - CVC: `123`
   - Name: `JUAN DELA CRUZ`

5. **Submit the payment:**
   - Click "Pay Now"
   - Payment will be processed immediately (no 3DS)
   - You'll see a success message

6. **Verify in backend:**
   - Check terminal logs for PayMongo API calls

## Next Steps

### For Testing
1. Test with the provided test cards (see PAYMONGO_SETUP.md)
2. Try partial payments
3. Try all payment methods (Card, GCash, GrabPay, Maya)
4. Test failed payment scenarios
5. Verify webhook processing in backend logs

### For Production
1. Update `.env` with real PayMongo live keys (`sk_live_...`, `pk_live_...`)
2. Set up webhook URL in PayMongo dashboard pointing to your production domain
3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for webhooks)
4. Test with real bank cards (in small amounts first)
5. Monitor the "Failed Payments" tab for any issues

## Status Meanings

When you see these statuses in the database or UI:

- `awaiting_payment_method` ‚è≥ - Intent created, waiting for card details
- `processing` ‚öôÔ∏è - Payment submitted, being processed
- `awaiting_next_action` üîê - 3DS authentication required
- `succeeded` ‚úÖ - Payment successful
