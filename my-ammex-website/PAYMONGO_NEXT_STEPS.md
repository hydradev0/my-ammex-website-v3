# PayMongo Integration - Next Steps & Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Complete (Customer Side)

### Payment Flow
- ‚úÖ Card input fields with validation
- ‚úÖ Payment method selection (Card, GCash, GrabPay, Maya)
- ‚úÖ Payment intent creation
- ‚úÖ Payment method creation and attachment
- ‚úÖ 3D Secure redirect (you saw: secure-authentication.paymongo.com)
- ‚úÖ E-wallet source creation and redirect
- ‚úÖ Database tracking with gateway fields

### 3DS Authentication Page
You're seeing **PayMongo's test authentication page** with three buttons:
- **Authorize test payment** ‚úÖ = Simulates successful authentication (like correct OTP)
- **Fail test payment** ‚ùå = Simulates failed authentication (like wrong OTP)
- **Cancel test payment** üö´ = User cancels

**In production:** Real customers see an actual OTP form from their bank. In test mode, PayMongo provides these simulation buttons.

## üìù What to Do Right Now

### Step 1: Complete 3DS Test

2. Use card `4120 0000 0000 0007`
3. When redirected to 3DS page, **click "Authorize test payment"**
4. Verify you're redirected back
5. Check payment status in database
6. Check backend logs for webhook

### Step 2: Test Failed Payment
1. Use card `5100 0000 0000 0198`
2. Verify error message appears
3. Check "Failed Payments" tab as admin
4. Verify failure reason is displayed

### Step 3: Test Webhook Processing
1. Watch backend terminal during payment
2. Look for logs like:
   ```
   PayMongo webhook received: payment.paid
   Payment updated: succeeded
   Invoice balance updated
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Database
```sql
-- Check payment record
SELECT 
  id, 
  status, 
  gateway_status, 
  gateway_payment_id, 
  failure_code, 
  failure_message,
  amount
FROM "Payment" 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Check invoice balance
SELECT 
  invoice_number, 
  total_amount, 
  paid_amount, 
  remaining_balance
FROM "Invoice"
WHERE id = YOUR_INVOICE_ID;
```
