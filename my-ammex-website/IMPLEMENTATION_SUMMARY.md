## Architecture Changes

### Payment Flow Transformation

**Before (Manual):**
1. Customer submits payment with receipt
2. Admin manually reviews and approves/rejects
3. Invoice updated after approval

**After (PayMongo):**
1. Customer initiates payment via gateway
2. PayMongo processes payment
3. Webhook automatically updates system
4. Invoice updated in real-time

### Benefits

1. **Automation:** Payments auto-approve on success
2. **Real-time:** Instant invoice balance updates
3. **Security:** PCI-DSS compliant, no card data stored
4. **Convenience:** Multiple payment methods
5. **Transparency:** Detailed failure tracking
6. **Partial Payments:** Full support maintained

## Testing Required

### Backend Testing

- [ ] Test webhook signature verification
- [ ] Test webhook event handling
- [ ] Test failed payment recording
- [ ] Test database schema migration

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Test payment form UI
- [ ] Test payment method selection
- [ ] Test amount validation
- [ ] Test partial payment logic
- [ ] Test failed payments tab display

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test full payment flow (card)
- [ ] Test GCash payment flow
- [ ] Test GrabPay payment flow
- [ ] Test Maya payment flow
- [ ] Test payment failure scenarios
- [ ] Test webhook receipt and processing
- [ ] Test invoice balance updates
- [ ] Test multiple partial payments

## Known Issues & Notes

### Installation Issues
- **TensorFlow Warning:** Existing TensorFlow dependency has Python build issues (unrelated to PayMongo)
- **Resolution:** Does not affect PayMongo functionality, can be addressed separately

### PayMongo Package
- Using npm `paymongo` package for backend REST API integration
- No official React SDK required - direct REST API calls via axios

### Environment Variables
- Placeholder keys provided in .env files
- **Action Required:** Replace with actual PayMongo keys from dashboard

### Database Migration
- Schema changes require running: `npm run db:sync` in backend
- Backup database before migrating

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Sign up for PayMongo account at https://dashboard.paymongo.com/
2. Obtain API keys (test mode for development)
3. Replace placeholder keys in environment files
4. Run database migration
5. Test payment flow in development

### Before Production
1. Get production API keys from PayMongo
2. Set up production webhook URL
3. Configure SSL certificate
4. Test all payment methods
5. Set up monitoring for failed payments
6. Review security checklist

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement payment method saving
2. Add recurring payments support
3. Implement refund processing
4. Add payment analytics dashboard
5. Support multi-currency payments
