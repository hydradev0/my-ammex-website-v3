# üõ°Ô∏è PayMongo Webhook Reliability & Prevention Guide

## üö® **Why Webhooks Get Disabled**

PayMongo disables webhooks when they consistently fail. Common causes:

### **1. Response Time Issues**
- **Timeout**: PayMongo expects response within **5 seconds**
- **Slow Processing**: Heavy database operations block response
- **Cold Starts**: Server takes time to wake up (Render free tier)

### **2. Error Responses**
- **500 Errors**: Server crashes during webhook processing
- **Database Errors**: Connection issues or query failures
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid webhook data handling

### **3. Infrastructure Issues**
- **Server Downtime**: Backend not accessible
- **Network Issues**: Firewall blocking webhook requests
- **SSL Problems**: HTTPS certificate issues

---

## ‚úÖ **Prevention Strategies**

### **1. Immediate Response Pattern**

**‚ùå BAD (Causes Disconnections):**
```javascript
// Synchronous processing - can timeout
const handleWebhook = async (req, res) => {
  // Heavy processing here (database updates, etc.)
  await processPayment(req.body);
  res.json({ success: true });
};
```

**‚úÖ GOOD (Prevents Disconnections):**
```javascript
// Immediate response + background processing
const handleWebhook = async (req, res) => {
  // Respond immediately
  res.json({ success: true, received: true });
  
  // Process in background
  setImmediate(() => processPayment(req.body));
};
```

### **2. Error Handling**

**‚ùå BAD:**
```javascript
// Throws errors that cause 500 responses
try {
  await processPayment(data);
} catch (error) {
  throw error; // This causes 500 error
}
```

**‚úÖ GOOD:**
```javascript
// Always return 200 OK, log errors
try {
  await processPayment(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Background processing error:', error);
  // Don't throw - webhook already responded
}
```

### **3. Health Monitoring**

**New Endpoints Added:**
- `GET /api/payments/webhook/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/payments/webhook/stats` - Statistics
- `GET /api/payments/webhook/test` - Accessibility test

---

## üîß **Implementation Changes Made**

### **1. Improved Webhook Handler**

**Before (Problematic):**
```javascript
const handlePayMongoWebhook = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Heavy logging and processing
  console.log('Full webhook data...');
  await processPayment(req.body);
  res.json({ success: true });
};
```

**After (Reliable):**
```javascript
const handlePayMongoWebhook = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Immediate response
  res.json({ success: true, received: true });
  
  // Background processing
  setImmediate(() => processWebhookInBackground(req));
};
```

### **2. Background Processing**

```javascript
const processWebhookInBackground = async (req) => {
  try {
    // All heavy processing here
    await processPayment(req.body);
  } catch (error) {
    // Log but don't throw
    console.error('Background error:', error);
  }
};
```

### **3. Monitoring Endpoints**

```bash
# Health Check
curl https://your-backend.com/api/payments/webhook/health

# Statistics
curl https://your-backend.com/api/payments/webhook/stats

# Accessibility Test
curl https://your-backend.com/api/payments/webhook/test
```

---

## üìä **Monitoring & Maintenance**

### **1. Daily Health Checks**

**Check These URLs Daily:**
```bash
# 1. Health Check
curl https://ammex.onrender.com/api/payments/webhook/health

# 2. Statistics
curl https://ammex.onrender.com/api/payments/webhook/stats

# 3. PayMongo Dashboard
# Go to: https://dashboard.paymongo.com/developers/webhooks
```

### **2. PayMongo Dashboard Monitoring**

**Weekly Checks:**
1. **Webhook Status**: Ensure it's "Enabled"
2. **Recent Deliveries**: Look for failed attempts
3. **Response Times**: Should be under 5 seconds
4. **Success Rate**: Should be 95%+ successful

### **3. Backend Log Monitoring**

**Watch For:**
```bash
# Good logs
üîî WEBHOOK RECEIVED: POST /api/payments/webhook
‚úÖ Background webhook processing completed

# Bad logs
‚ùå Error in background webhook processing
‚ùå Invalid webhook signature
‚ùå Database connection error
```

---

## üö® **Emergency Response**

### **If Webhook Gets Disabled Again:**

**1. Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl https://ammex.onrender.com/api/payments/webhook/health

# Check PayMongo dashboard
# Go to: https://dashboard.paymongo.com/developers/webhooks
```

**2. Re-enable Webhook:**
1. Go to PayMongo Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click on your webhook
3. Click "Re-enable" or "Edit"
4. Verify URL: `https://ammex.onrender.com/api/payments/webhook`
5. Save changes

**3. Test Immediately:**
```bash
# Make a test payment
# Check backend logs for webhook processing
# Verify payment appears in database
```

## üîç **Troubleshooting Checklist**

### **Webhook Not Receiving Events:**
- [ ] Backend is running and accessible
- [ ] Webhook URL is correct in PayMongo dashboard
- [ ] Webhook status is "Enabled"
- [ ] No firewall blocking requests
- [ ] SSL certificate is valid

### **Webhook Receiving but Failing:**
- [ ] Check backend logs for errors
- [ ] Verify database connection
- [ ] Check webhook signature verification
- [ ] Ensure environment variables are set
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint manually

### **Payments Not Processing:**
- [ ] Webhook is being delivered successfully
- [ ] Background processing is completing
- [ ] Database updates are working
- [ ] Payment records exist in database
- [ ] Invoice balance is updating

## üìà **Performance Optimization**

### **1. Response Time Optimization**

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Immediate response (under 100ms)
- ‚úÖ Background processing
- ‚úÖ Error isolation
- ‚úÖ Minimal logging in main handler

### **2. Database Optimization**

**Consider:**
- Database connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Indexing on frequently queried fields
- Connection timeout settings

### **3. Server Optimization**

**For Render.com:**
- Upgrade from free tier to paid plan (eliminates cold starts)
- Use process managers (PM2)
- Implement health checks
- Monitor memory usage
