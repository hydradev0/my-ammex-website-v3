# Admin Notification Fix - PayMongo Integration

## Issue Found ‚úÖ

The admin was not receiving notifications when customers made PayMongo payments because:

1. **Webhook handlers only created customer notifications**
2. **No admin notifications were being created**

## What Was Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Added Admin Notifications for Successful Payments

**File:** `backend/controllers/paymentController.js`
**Function:** `handlePaymentPaid()`

**What was added:**
```javascript
// Create notification for admin
await Notification.create({
  customerId: null, // Admin notification
  type: 'payment_received',
  title: 'New Payment Received',
  message: `Payment of ‚Ç±${amount} received from ${customerName} for invoice ${invoiceNumber} via PayMongo.`,
  data: {
    paymentId: payment.id,
    invoiceId: payment.invoiceId,
    customerId: payment.customerId,
    amount: paymentAmount,
    gatewayReference: paymentData.id,
    paymentMethod: 'paymongo'
  }
});
```

### 2. Added Admin Notifications for Failed Payments

**File:** `backend/controllers/paymentController.js`
**Function:** `handlePaymentFailed()`

**What was added:**
```javascript
// Create notification for admin
await Notification.create({
  customerId: null, // Admin notification
  type: 'payment_failed',
  title: 'Payment Failed',
  message: `Payment of ‚Ç±${amount} from customer failed via PayMongo. Reason: ${failureMessage}`,
  data: {
    paymentId: payment.id,
    invoiceId: payment.invoiceId,
    customerId: payment.customerId,
    amount: payment.amount,
    failureCode: failureCode,
    failureMessage: failureMessage,
    paymentMethod: 'paymongo'
  }
});
```

## What Admin Will See Now ‚úÖ

### 1. In Notifications Bell Icon
- **"New Payment Received"** - When customer payment succeeds
- **"Payment Failed"** - When customer payment fails

### 2. In Balance Tracking Tab
- Payment appears in `PaymentHistory` with `action: 'approved'`
- Shows customer name, invoice, amount, payment method
- Gateway reference ID stored

### 3. In Payment History Tab
- All successful PayMongo payments listed
- Full transaction history
- Searchable and filterable

### 4. In Failed Payments Tab
- Failed payments with failure reasons
- Customer and invoice details
- Failure codes for troubleshooting

## How It Works Now üîÑ

### Customer Makes Payment:
1. Customer fills card details
2. Clicks "Pay Now"
3. PayMongo processes payment
4. Payment status: `pending_payment` ‚Üí `awaiting_next_action` ‚Üí `processing` ‚Üí `succeeded`

### Webhook Receives Success:
1. PayMongo sends webhook: `payment.paid`
2. Backend updates payment status to `succeeded`
3. Invoice balance updated
4. **PaymentHistory** record created with `action: 'approved'`
5. **Customer notification** created: "Payment Successful"
6. **Admin notification** created: "New Payment Received" ‚úÖ NEW!

### Admin Sees:
1. **Notification bell** shows new payment
2. **Balance Tracking** tab shows the payment
3. **Payment History** tab shows transaction
4. Invoice balance is updated

### If Payment Fails:
1. PayMongo sends webhook: `payment.failed`
2. Backend updates payment status to `failed`
3. Failure code and message stored
4. **Customer notification** created: "Payment Failed"
5. **Admin notification** created: "Payment Failed" ‚úÖ NEW!
6. **Failed Payments tab** shows the failure

## Testing Checklist ‚úÖ

### Test 1: Successful Payment Notification
1. Customer makes payment with card `4343 4343 4343 4345`
2. Wait for webhook (or use test webhook in PayMongo dashboard)
3. **Check Admin:**
   - [ ] Notification bell shows "New Payment Received"
   - [ ] Balance Tracking tab shows payment
   - [ ] Payment History tab shows transaction
   - [ ] Invoice balance updated

### Test 2: Failed Payment Notification
1. Customer makes payment with card `5100 0000 0000 0198`
2. Payment fails immediately
3. **Check Admin:**
   - [ ] Notification bell shows "Payment Failed"
   - [ ] Failed Payments tab shows the failure
   - [ ] Failure reason displayed

### Test 3: 3DS Payment Notification
1. Customer uses card `4120 0000 0000 0007`
2. Goes through 3DS authentication
3. Clicks "Authorize test payment"
4. Webhook fires after auth
5. **Check Admin:**
   - [ ] Notification received
   - [ ] Payment appears in Balance Tracking
   - [ ] Payment marked as succeeded

## Database Changes ‚ùå NONE

No database migrations needed! We're just creating additional notification records.

## Restart Required ‚úÖ

After the fix:
1. **Restart backend server** to apply changes
2. Test with a new payment
3. Check admin notifications
