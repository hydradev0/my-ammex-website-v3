# Puppeteer Deployment Fix for Render

## Problem
Payment receipt PDF downloads work on localhost but fail in production on Render with the error:
```
Error: Could not find Chrome (ver. 141.0.7390.78). This can occur if either
1. you did not perform an installation before running the script (e.g. `npx puppeteer browsers install chrome`) or
2. your cache path is incorrectly configured (which is: /opt/render/.cache/puppeteer).
```

## Root Cause
Render's production environment doesn't have Chrome installed by default, which is required by Puppeteer for PDF generation.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Automatic Chrome Installation
Updated `backend/package.json` to include a postinstall script that automatically installs Chrome:
```json
"postinstall": "npx puppeteer browsers install chrome && echo 'Backend dependencies and Chrome installed successfully'"
```

### 2. Enhanced Puppeteer Configuration
Modified the Puppeteer launch options in `backend/controllers/paymentController.js` to be more production-friendly:
- Added production-specific Chrome executable path detection
- Enhanced browser arguments for better stability in containerized environments
- Added proper error handling for Chrome-specific issues

### 3. Better Error Handling
Added specific error detection for Chrome/Puppeteer issues with user-friendly error messages.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Redeploy your application** - The postinstall script will automatically install Chrome during the build process
2. **Monitor the build logs** - Look for the message "Backend dependencies and Chrome installed successfully"
3. **Test the PDF download** - Try downloading a payment receipt to verify the fix

## Alternative Solutions (if the above doesn't work)

### Option 1: Use Puppeteer Core with System Chrome
If the automatic installation doesn't work, you can try using `puppeteer-core` instead of `puppeteer` and install Chrome manually in your Render environment.

### Option 2: Switch to a Different PDF Library
Consider using libraries like:
- `@react-pdf/renderer` for client-side PDF generation
- `pdfkit` for server-side PDF generation without browser dependencies
- `html-pdf-node` as an alternative to Puppeteer

### Option 3: Use a PDF Service
Consider using external PDF generation services like:
- Puppeteer as a Service (PaaS)
- HTML/CSS to PDF API services
- AWS Lambda with Puppeteer

## Verification

After deployment, test the payment receipt download functionality:
1. Login to your customer portal
2. Navigate to payment receipts
3. Try downloading a receipt PDF
4. Check the server logs for any Chrome-related errors

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check the Render build logs for Chrome installation messages
2. Verify that the postinstall script ran successfully
3. Check if there are any memory or resource constraints on your Render instance
4. Consider upgrading to a higher-tier Render plan if resource constraints are the issue

## Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are required for this fix. The solution works with the existing configuration.
